        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
            We hope this email finds you well. We are reaching out to inform you that one of your negotiations is still marked as pending, even though an advertisement has already been placed in your space and the payment has been processed by the admin.
        </p>

        To ensure the completion of this process and avoid any potential misunderstandings, we kindly request you to review the pending negotiation and take appropriate action. Failure to do so will result in the deactivation of your account, all of your transactions will be voided or deleted and you will no longer be able to access our system. 
        </p>
